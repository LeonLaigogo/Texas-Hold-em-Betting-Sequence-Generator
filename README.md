# ♠️ Texas Hold'em Betting Sequence Generator

This project is a simulation tool built in Google Colab for generating betting sequences in Texas Hold'em poker games. It allows users to explore different player behaviors, action orders, and simulate rounds for strategy research, data analysis, or AI training.

## 📌 Key Features

- ✅ Written in Python and runs entirely in Colab
- ✅ Simulates player action sequences across multiple betting rounds
- ✅ Supports custom number of players and betting stages
- ✅ Suitable for AI model training, behavior analysis, and strategy simulation
